= Sail Asciidoctor Plugin

An https://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor] extension for including code from
https://github.com/rems-project/sail[Sail] ISA specifications into
Asciidoc documents, primarily aimed at supporting documentation for
RISC-V extensions using the
https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv[sail-riscv] model.

== Installation

asciidoctor-sail is published on https://rubygems.org[rubygems], so it can be installed with gem install:

[source,sh]
----
gem install asciidoctor-sail
----

The requirements are simply asciidoctor itself, or asciidoctor and
asciidoctor-diagram if encoding diagrams are generated (which also
require the https://wavedrom.com[WaveDrom] editor to be installed).
asciidoctor-pdf is also supported for PDF generation.

== Documentation

Documentation is available as a PDF
https://github.com/Alasdair/asciidoctor-sail/blob/2e959a618a01455266568e1e1e5460fd87fb1859/doc/built/sail_to_asciidoc.pdf[here]. The
PDF is itself built with asciidoctor-pdf and asciidoctor-sail, using
the various examples in `doc/examples`.
