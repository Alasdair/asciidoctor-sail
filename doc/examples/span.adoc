=== Spans

What if we want to include some arbitrary span of Sail source rather
than select definitions? This can be acheived using `$span` directives
in Sail.

==== Sail source

[source,sail]
----
include::span.sail
----

==== Result

[source,adoc]
----
sail::PREAMBLE[from=span,type=span]
----

sail::PREAMBLE[from=span,type=span]
