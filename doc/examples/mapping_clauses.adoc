=== Documenting mapping clauses

Sail allows us to specify bi-directional functions, called
_mappings_. These can be broken into multiple scattered functions in
the same way that functions can (see the `clauses.adoc` example for
details).

==== Sail source

[source,sail]
----
include::mapping_clauses.sail[]
----

==== Result

However in this case, we can select the clause we want to document by
matching on either the left or the right pattern of the mapping.

[source,adoc]
----
sail::encdec[from=mapping-clauses,left-clause="Add(_, _, _)",type=mapping]
----

which produces:

sail::encdec[from=mapping-clauses,left-clause="Add(_, _, _)",type=mapping]

NOTE: The matching language in the `left-clause` and `right-clause`
attributes is a subset of the Sail pattern language that includes
constructor patterns, identifiers, wildcards, and binary literals.
