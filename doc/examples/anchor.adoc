=== Anchors

An _anchor_ is a special Sail attribute `$anchor` that we can attach
documentation comments to. This allows us to include comments that are
not otherwise associated with any toplevel Sail definition. The anchor
directive provides the name we use to reference the comment in the
asciidoc source.
