=== Result ===

Sail allows us to specify bi-directional functions, called
_mappings_. These can be broken into multiple scattered functions in
the same way that functions can (see the `clauses.adoc` example for
details). However in this case, we can select the clause we want to
document by matching on either the left or the right pattern of the
mapping.

[source,adoc]
----
sail::encdec[left-clause="Add(_, _, _)",type=mapping]
----

which produces:

sail::encdec[left-clause="Add(_, _, _)",type=mapping]

NOTE: The matching language in the `left-clause` and `right-clause`
attributes is a subset of the Sail pattern language that includes
constructor patterns, identifiers, wildcards, and binary literals.
